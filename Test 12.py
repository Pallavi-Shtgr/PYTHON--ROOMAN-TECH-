# Write a Python function create_data_structures() that performs the following tasks:

# 1. Create a list called my_list containing the numbers [1, 2, 3].
# 2. Create a tuple called my_tuple containing the strings ("apple", "banana", "cherry").
# 3. Create a dictionary called my_dict with keys as {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}.
# 4. Create a set called my_set with values {1, 2, 3}.

# Your function should return all four data structures as a tuple in the order: (list, tuple, dictionary, set).
